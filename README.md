Microsoft Sentinel SOC Incident Detection & Response
________________________________________
Executive Summary
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow using Microsoft Sentinel for detection engineering and Microsoft Defender for centralized incident investigation and response.
Azure Activity logs were ingested into Sentinel, where custom analytics rules were created using KQL to detect suspicious, repeated administrative activity. Alerts generated by Sentinel were automatically converted into security incidents and investigated through the Defender unified SecOps portal. The incident was triaged, analyzed, documented, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and closed following SOC best practices.
This project highlights practical SIEM skills including log ingestion, detection logic development, incident triage, investigation, and professional incident reporting.

Tools & Technologies Used
•	Microsoft Sentinel – SIEM, analytics rules, detections
•	Microsoft Defender – Incident management & investigation
•	Azure Activity Logs – Subscription-level telemetry
•	Kusto Query Language (KQL) – Detection logic
•	MITRE ATT&CK Framework – Threat classification

Incident Details
•	Incident ID: SENT-INC-001
•	Incident Type: Suspicious Activity / Brute Force-like Behavior
•	Detection Source: Microsoft Sentinel Analytics Rule
•	Investigation Platform: Microsoft Defender Unified SecOps

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
•	Tactic: Initial Access
•	Technique: Brute Force (T1110)

Dates & Times
•	Activity Observed: During repeated Azure administrative write operations
•	Detection Time: Within 5 minutes of analytics rule execution
•	Investigation Time: Immediately after incident creation
•	Resolution Time: Same day

Affected Systems / Assets
•	Azure Subscription
•	Azure Resource Groups (test resources used for validation)
No production workloads, user data, or sensitive systems were impacted.

Incident Timeline
Time (UTC)	Event
T0	Multiple Azure resource write operations occurred
T0 + 5 min	Sentinel analytics rule triggered
T0 + 6 min	Incident created in Defender portal
T0 + 10 min	Analyst investigation started
T0 + 20 min	Activity validated as suspicious
T0 + 25 min	Incident closed

Impact Assessment
Scope
•	Limited to subscription-level administrative activity
•	No lateral movement or persistence detected
Business Impact
•	Operations: No disruption
•	Data Confidentiality: No data exposure
•	Integrity: No unauthorized modification
•	Financial / Regulatory: No impact

Actions Taken (Response Actions)
Containment
•	Activity monitored to confirm no continued malicious behavior
Eradication
•	No malicious artifacts identified
Recovery
•	No recovery actions required
Evidence Preservation
•	Azure Activity logs retained in Log Analytics workspace
•	Incident artifacts preserved in Defender portal
Stakeholder Communication
•	Incident documented for SOC reporting and review

Evidence & Findings
Evidence Reviewed
•	AzureActivity logs
•	Sentinel analytics rule results
•	Incident timeline and correlated events in Defender
Key Findings
•	Repeated administrative write operations occurred in a short time window
•	Activity exceeded normal baseline behavior
•	No evidence of successful compromise

Root Cause Analysis
Primary Cause
•	Automated or scripted actions generating repeated Azure resource write operations
Contributing Factors
•	Absence of prior alerting for abnormal administrative activity
•	Lack of baseline monitoring before Sentinel rule deployment

Recommendations
Immediate
•	Continue monitoring for repeated administrative actions
•	Maintain alert grouping to reduce noise
Short-Term
•	Add analytics rules for:
o	Privilege escalation attempts
o	Suspicious role assignments
Long-Term
•	Expand Sentinel data sources
•	Implement SOAR playbooks for automated response
•	Perform periodic threat-hunting exercises

Appendices
Appendix A — Analytics Rule
•	Rule Name: Brute Force Login Attempts – Azure Activity
•	Data Source: AzureActivity
•	Query Language: KQL

Appendix B — Incident Closure
•	Classification: True Positive
•	Severity: Medium
•	Resolution: Mitigated / Monitoring
•	Status: Closed

Notes
This project was conducted in a controlled lab environment to demonstrate SOC analyst capabilities aligned with entry-level and junior cybersecurity roles. The workflow reflects current Microsoft SecOps architecture, where Sentinel detections are investigated and managed through the Defender unified SecOps portal.
